**Respawner** is a plugin that automatically respawns players after they die, either at the same location where they died, one of their sleeping bags, or a random location. You can set players to automatically wake up via the configuration as well.

## Permissions
- `respawner.use` -- allows player to automatically respawn and wake up

## Configuration
You can configure the settings in the Respawner.json file under the oxide/config directory.

  "Automatically wake up (true/false)": true,
  "Respawn at same location (true/false)": false,
  "Use sleeping bags if available (true/false)": true
}
```
